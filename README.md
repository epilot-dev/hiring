## ðŸ¦„ Who we are 

<p align="center"><img alt="epilot" src="/Jobs GIF-downsized_large.gif" width="600"></p>

We are epilot, an innovative global scale-up from Cologne.
Come build the leading ecosystem for energy ecommerce with us!

Founded in 2017, go-live of our app in 2018. Our vision is that companies can sell even complex products online as easily as a pair of shoes.

In the end of 2020  we were already 80+ epilots (thatÂ´s how we like to call ourselves)  working on our common vision - number still counting. To date our app is already helping 75+ customers from the energy market to make their lives easier selling their complex energy products online. Even though the energy market is our starting point, our long term vision is much broader: we want to enable companies from any markets to sell their complex products with our app (e.g. insurance, real-estate etc.) as easy as a pair of shoes online. 

Our key to success? We build on a founders team with a decade on expertise in growing successful businesses, a bunch of experts from software engineering, product management and sales, a great product-market fit and reputable shareholders. But most important: in the end it is of course all the talented people at epilot and the great teamspirit which makes epilot a great company - both for our employees and our customers.

To further scale our product we are constantly looking for exceptional talents to join our team!
